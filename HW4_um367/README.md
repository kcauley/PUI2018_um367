# PUI2018_um367

This repository contains home work 4 deliverables for my class of PUI 2018.

In home work 4 we did the following:
  - We looked at an empirical proof of Central Limit theorem by plotting the distribution of sample means from different base distributions and observing that they are normally distributed.
  - We learned how to formulate a Hypothesis test
  - We conducted a simple one sample z test
