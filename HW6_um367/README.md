# Homework 5 - Marvin Mananghaya (MSM796)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Assignment 1
I worked alone for this part as required. I made my necessary comments of Soham's HW4 Citibike assignment. You can refer to my comments i've made in the following [link](https://github.com/SohamMody/PUI2018_srm699/blob/master/HW4_srm699/CitibikeReview_msm796.md ).

## Assignment 2 
I worked alone for this part. I have explored and performed the necessary tasks. Please see below for the assignment.

## Assignment 3 
I worked alone for this part. I performed the tasks as required by the skeleton notebook and defined evalChisq function as this was mentioned in the slack chat as something that we have to define by ourselves.

## Assignment 4 
I worked alone for this part.  I started with using the helper functions that i made during HW4 that downloads multiple citibike datasets and compiles them into one dataframe. Since the assignment required atleast two months, i made use of the August and September 2018 citibike data. I've done some data exploration and outlier detection, although manually deteremined the threshold, and performed the required two sample testing.

For the extra credit problem, i took advantage of python packages Geopandas and Shapely to assist me in identifying if the Longitude and Latitude data falls under a certain borough. I took advantage of NYC Open data to get borough boundaries (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm), since i'm encountering difficulties automating the download process of the geojson file, i've downloaded it manually and uploaded the file in my repository [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinalklaulitz/PUI2018_msm796/master/HW5_msm796/Borough%20Boundaries.geojson ). Then i checked if Long-Lat points are within the boundary <b>(NOTE: THIS TAKES REALLY LONG)</b>. From there, i did some necessarily outlier detection, exploratory data analysis and performed the required testing.

Required libraries that may not be in the default environment of the ADRF's for python 3.7:
dateutil
requests
zipfile
io
Geopandas
 Shapely
